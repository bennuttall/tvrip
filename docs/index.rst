Welcome!

tvrip is a small command line script that brings together several other
utilities (Handbrake, Atomic Parsley, GOCR, etc.) with the aim of making it
relatively simple to rip whole seasons or series of TV episodes from DVD to
high quality MP4s, along with optional subtitles (either ripped straight as
images into VOBSUB or tranlsated into text SubRip).
